# OSpam
OSpam is an Omegle Spam Bot, which can be used to advertise or simply just to get a message round this annonymous chatroom.
### About
OSpam is a free Omegle Spam Bot, which can do anything you like. The code is obfuscated to prevent unauthorized use, and is made by PiggyPlex.
### Instructions
First, head to **Omegle.com** and select **text**. You may optionally add interests to your liking; please note adding interests may increase the time taken to find people. This script can only be used on a computer with the ability to use Inspect Element.
Open up the Developer Tool's Console:
#### Chrome, Opera, and Firefox (and possibly others)
Windows: **CTL+SHIFT+J**
Mac: **CMD+SHIFT+J**
#### Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge
Windows: **F12**, then press **Console**

Once you have the console open, paste the script in from [script.js](/script.js), edit the message to your liking, then hit enter. The script should automatically send a message, then look for a new user automatically and repeat this process. You can kill the bot by either refreshing the page or closing the tab.
Please note that the script may not start **until the console is closed**. This is due to the continuous calling of the debugger in order to prevent from the code being stolen or unobfuscated.
Another thing to mention is that after a certain period of time, Omegle may ask for you to complete a Captcha. Complete it, then press the new/stop button and the script should continue. If the script stops and there is no captcha,the script may stop working due to the way Omegle works. It shouldn't happen too often, and if you experience this, all you have to do is press the new/stop button.
This will hopefully be fixed in a later update.
