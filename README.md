# OSpam
OSpam is an Omegle Spam Bot, which can be used to advertise or simply just to get a message round this annonymous chatroom.
### Instructions
First, head to **Omegle.com** and select **text**. You may optionally add interests to your liking; please note adding interests may increase the time taken to find people. This script can only be used on a computer with the ability to use Inspect Element.
Open up the Developer Tool's Console:
#### Chrome, Opera, and Firefox (and possibly others)
Windows: **CTL+SHIFT+J**
Mac: **CMD+SHIFT+J**
#### Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge
Windows: **F12**, then press **Console**
Once you have the console open, paste the script in from [script.js](/script.js), edit the message to your liking, then hit enter. The script should automatically send a message, then look for a new user automatically and repeat this process. You can kill the bot by either refreshing the page or closing the tab.
